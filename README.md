# go_dublin_bus

 ## *In Development*

 _`go_dublin_bus`_ is simple wrapper developed in Go to expose the RTPI REST web services API endpoints, and provide a simple interface for Go developers to query this service in Go. Additionally this service implements a number of new services built on top of the existing endpoints to provide users with more powerful queries.
